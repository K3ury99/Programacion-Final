# Final project  - Programming III 🍃
> [!TIP]  
> This is the final project of Programming III, the code of the personal page that I used, and the automation of it, are in Github. I also imported my project from Github directly into Azure DevOps. I put a lot of effort into this project, in which I spent more than 24 hours in a row developing the code for my page, testing each component one by one, and organizing every point of the documentation to ensure I achieved the highest grade. It was truly a process I thoroughly enjoyed.  
>
> This marks the last task for this subject. Thank you for all the knowledge shared over these four months of continuous work. I hope you liked everything I meticulously added. Wishing you a happy rest of the day, afternoon, or night.
